Simply inventory is a stock of physical assets. The physical assets have some economic value, which can be either in the form of material, men, or money. Inventory is also called as an idle resource if it is not utilized. Inventory may be regarded as those goods which are procured, stored, and used for day-to-day functioning of the organization. Inventory can be in the form of physical resource such as raw materials, semi- finished goods used in the process of production, finished goods which are ready for delivery to the consumers, human resources, or financial resources such as working capital etc. Inventories means measures of power and wealth of a nation or of an individual during centuries ago. That is a businessman or a nation’s wealth, and power were assessed in terms of grams of gold, heads of cattle, quintals of rice etc.
