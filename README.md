# TO CONDUCT ABC ANALYSIS AND TO FORECAST THE DEMAND OF FMCG PRODUCTS AND SUGGEST OPTIMUM PROCUREMENT  STRATEGY

## ABSTARCT
Inventory is one of the most crucial aspects of any business model. A close tab on the movement of inventory can make or break your business and that’s why entrepreneurs always emphasize on effective inventory management. While a few business owners do understand the significance and cruciality of tracking inventory on a regular basis, some fail to realize its importance making their business fall through the unseen cracks. 

Accurate inventory tracking allows brands to fulfil orders timely and accurately. Inventory management in businesses must grow as the company expands. With a strategic plan in place that optimizes the process of overseeing and managing inventory, including real-time data of inventory conditions and levels, companies can achieve inventory management benefits that include: Accurate Order Fulfilment, Better Inventory Planning and Ordering, Increased Customer Satisfaction, Organized Warehouse, Minimize the Blockage of Financial Resources. 

The objective of this study is to devise an optimal inventory policy for a FGMC products with the highest annual consumption value procured by Bharat Glass House. Applying the selective Inventory control technique to determine the items with the highest consumption value (hence, sales) so that special policy can be devised to carefully control few of those items for efficient functioning of the system. Forecasting technique is further implied over selected items to study the future strategy of procurement for those items at various point of time. Procurement schedule is devised for knowing the optimal ordering time for a product and hence an optimum procurement policy is obtained.

## KEY CONCEPTS
### INVENTORY MANAGEMENT
Simply inventory is a stock of physical assets. The physical assets have some economic value, which can be either in the form of material, men, or money. Inventory is also called as an idle resource if it is not utilized. Inventory may be regarded as those goods which are procured, stored, and used for day-to-day functioning of the organization. Inventory can be in the form of physical resource such as raw materials, semi- finished goods used in the process of production, finished goods which are ready for delivery to the consumers, human resources, or financial resources such as working capital etc. Inventories means measures of power and wealth of a nation or of an individual during centuries ago. That is a businessman or a nation’s wealth, and power were assessed in terms of grams of gold, heads of cattle, quintals of rice etc. 

In recent past, inventories mean measure of business failure. Therefore, businessmen have started to put more emphasis on the liquidity of assets as inventories, until fast turnover has become a goal to be pursues for its own sake. Today inventories are viewed as a large potential risk rather than as a measure of wealth due to the fast developments and changes in product life. The concept of inventories at 
present has necessitated the use of scientific techniques in the inventory management called as inventory control. Thus, inventory control is the technique of maintaining stock items at desired levels. In 
other words, inventory control is the means by which material of the correct quality and quantity is made available as and when it is needed with due regard to economy in the 
holding cost, ordering costs, setup costs, production costs, purchase costs and working capital. 

Inventory Management answers two questions viz. How much to order? and when to order? 

### OBJECTIVE OF INVENTORY MANAGEMENT 
Inventory has the following objectives: 
 
- To supply the raw material, sub-assemblies, semi-finished goods, finished goods, etc. to its users as per their requirements at right time and at right price. 
- To maintain the minimum level of waste, surplus, inactive, scrap and obsolete items. 
- To minimize the inventory costs such as holding cost, replacement cost, breakdown cost and shortage cost. 
- To maximize the efficiency in production and distribution. 
- To maintain the overall inventory investment at the lowest level. 
- To treat inventory as investment which is risky? For some items, investment may lead to higher profits and for others less profit.

### FEATURES OF INVENTORY MANAGEMENT
1. Setup Cost
2. Unit rroduction cost or Unit purchase price
3. Selling price
4. Inventory holding cost
5. Shortage cost
6. The Demand pattern
7. The ordering Cycle
8. Continous Review
9. Periodic Review
10. Delivery lag or lead time

## SELECTIVE INVENTORY CONTROL
In practice when a firm maintains a variety of items that too in large quantities in its inventory, all items obviously cannot and need not be controlled (i.e., keeping record of time interval between successive reviews of demand; order frequencies; expected demand rate; order quantities etc.) with equal attention. All items are not of equal importance to the firm in such terms as sales, profits, availability etc. one way of exercising proper degree of overall control and various types of items held in stocks is to classify them into groups based on the degree of control or intensity of managerial attention. By selectively applying inventory control policies to these different groups, inventory objectives can be achieved with lower inventory levels than with a single policy applied to all items, these techniques are also known as selective multi-item control techniques.
### ABC Analysis
ABC Analysis is a comprehensive way of segmenting your customers or products to make sure that you get the most out of your time and your resources when you’re servicing them by breaking the items down into three easily distinguishable categories. This technique involves the classification of inventory items into three categories A, B and C in descending order of annual consumption and annual monetary value of each item.

**A – Class items:** more costly and valuable items are classified as “A”. Such items have large investments but not much in number, for example say, 10% of items account for 60%-75% of the total capital invested in inventory. So more careful and closer control is needed for such items. The items of this category should be ordered frequently but in small no. 

**B - Class items:**  the items having average consumption value are classified as “B”. Nearly 15% of items in an inventory account of 20%-25% of the total investment. These items have less importance than a class items but are much costly to pay more attention on their use.

**C – Class items:** the items having low consumption value are put in class “C”. Nearly 75% of the inventory items account only for 10%-15% of the total invested capital. Such items can be stocked at an operative place where people can help themselves with any requisition formality.

## FORECASTING

Forecasting helps a company to set inventory targets to ensure that their inventory allows them to maximize their operations and output. It also aids companies in optimizing the deployment of their inventory, deal with uncertainties, limitations, and difficulties within their supply chain.

## PROCUREMENT

* Procurement is the process of purchasing goods or services and is usually in reference to business spending. Procurement, in the simplest sense, involves a series of activities and processes that are necessary for an organization to acquire necessary products or services. It is very important to business because an organization can end up spending well over half of its revenue on purchasing goods and services, proper 
procurement management is vital. Even the slightest decrease in purchasing costs can have a significantly direct impact on profits, while a lack of strategic decisions can sink an otherwise financially healthy company. It can make the difference between success and failure.
* Procurement management ensures that all items and services are properly acquired so that projects and processes can proceed efficiently and successfully. Procurement and inventory management models in the 
operations management and supply chain management literature usually assume constant or known procurement prices while modelling in detail transaction costs, storage costs and costs associated with fulfilling a stochastic demand.

## METHODOLOGY
### OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY
To forecast the demand for certain FMCG products and to determine the optimum procurement policy for a few products.
